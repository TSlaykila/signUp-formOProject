# Typing Sign-Up Web Page
- Overview
- The Typing Sign-Up Web Page is a project designed for programmers to practice typing while focusing on writing code, rather than on the act of typing itself. This project features a responsive layout that adjusts for different screen sizes and includes a sign-up form to collect essential user details.

### Features
- Responsive Design: Utilizes flexbox for layout management, ensuring the page looks great on all devices.
- Sign-Up Form: Collects user information, including first name, last name, email, phone number, password, and confirmation of password.
- Background Image: A visually appealing background image of a programmer typing, overlaid with a semi-transparent black layer for contrast.
- User-Friendly UI: Easy-to-use forms and intuitive navigation.
- Technologies Used
- HTML5: Provides semantic structure for the webpage.
- CSS3: Styled using flexbox, custom fonts, and responsive design techniques.
- Fonts: The page uses the custom font Norse-Bold for the logo, along with system fonts like Courier New and Lucida Sans.
- Media Queries: Ensures the page is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- 
File Structure
- index.html        # Main HTML file containing the webpage structure.
- style.css         # Stylesheet containing the CSS rules for layout and design.
- Norse-Bold.otf    # Custom font file used for the logo.
- odin-lined.png    # Logo image file used on the left container.
  
### How It Works
- The left side container displays a background image with a semi-transparent overlay, and the right side container contains the sign-up form. The page uses flexbox to position the form and other elements responsively. Form input fields are provided for name, email, phone number, and password. A sign-up button is included to create an account.

### Future Enhancements
- Backend Integration: The form action is set to database, but can be connected to a backend server for actual user registration.
- User Authentication: Implement functionality for users to log in if they already have an account.
- Styling Improvements: Enhance the UI/UX, adding more interactivity and improving mobile responsiveness.
